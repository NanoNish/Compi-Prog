# Compi-Prog

It is a collection of all my attempts on various competitive programming platforms. The codes are not all correct as some of them ar just random attempts but most problems are completed. It is made for my own sake and anyone wondering about my style of writing code.
PS None of the commits are pushed during the contest :)
